# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Takuya. I currently work at Thrillworks as Full Stack Software Engineer. I enjoy developing personal projects besides full-time job.

## My Personal Projects
- [SnapVote](https://snapvote.live) Embedding survey tool to collect user feedbacks.
- [LiftySaaS](https://liftysaas.com) Platform where indie hackers showcase their SaaS!
- [fts-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fts-utils). Utility functions for functional programmers written in TypeScript.
- [create-prettier-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-prettier-json). This generates a prettier config file with rules I like.
